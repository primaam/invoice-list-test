## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure to install the server and client dependencies.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
```

### Running the application

after the installation is done, we can run the apps with this following steps

1. To run the server, go to the `backend` folder and execute:

```bash
   node index.js
```

2. To run the client, navigate to the `frontend` folder and execute:

```bash
   npm start
```

### Notes

-   Ensure that your database is set up and configured correctly in the backend.
-   Make sure both the backend and frontend are running on different ports (e.g., backend on 5000 and frontend on 3000).
-   Adjust any CORS settings as needed to allow communication between the client and server.
